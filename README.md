Organization
------
The folders that have a "kwk17-" are submodules. They link to my other repositories. This is because they were forked and so I wanted to preserve the original owners.

Outline/Diary of KWK
------
- **Day 1:** First we went over console commands such as cp, mv, etc. We were partnered off and worked on the refridgerator lab. During the afternoon, we reviewed HTML and CSS. I tried out CSS before but I was by no means an expert. I didn't really enjoy styling my websites simply because I have very bad taste and everything doesn't look as nice as professional websites. Taylor(lead instructor) lead us through a code with me and we created her profile page. We switched partners and were given the task of creating a profile page for our partner. We had to include their name, a picture, a quote, and three things they enjoyed. I struggled with this because I ***could not*** get my "P profile" vertically centered. I went home and googled a bunch and finally found out you can use `vertical-align:middle`, took long enough for me to find it.
- **Day 2:** We learned p5, which is very similar to Processing which I had experience with. We drew aliens on our whiteboards and then tried to recreate them in p5 just for some experience creating shapes and understanding the coordinate system in p5. There were a few exercises that I did with a partner, but because I can't recall who was my partner that day, those exercises are not added here. An instructor led us through a DVD code along, but I later just added more to it. I can't remember what day this was but Marley(a TA) led us through the p5.play library and we worked together on the p5-play-lab. I also finished an exercise that sits in the p5 folder. We worked with partners to create the tron bike.
- **Day 3:** I didn't have experience with Javascript so it was a bit of a learning curve. Even though Java and Javascript are similar, the classes and objects threw me off quite a bit. We learned about arrays and functions in the folders array-intro, function, and the two kwk17 javascript submodules. I also completed two exercises in the binary converter lab and the array iteration mini lab. We finished by learning dom manipulation in a code along.
- **Day 4:** We learned about APIs and started the day off by creating our own gif generator page. One is a submodule and the v2 was created because having a page with 10 gifs annoyed me so I made another version where only one or no gif is on the page at all times. We went over Bootstrap and created a website as a class centered around a corgi. The lone script.js in the folder is when we went over hashes/objects(?). The last submodule was a cryptography exercise to test our understanding of Javascript. During the afternoon we are allowed to experiment so I continued working on my dreamHome which is supposed to be a copy of the airbnb website to practice Bootstrap.
- **Day 5:** We learned DOM manipulation today and I completed the lab with a partner, but I don't remember who so the project in this repository is currently incomplete. (I will finish it at a later date when I have more time.) During the rest of the day, I worked on the mini final project, the book to movie adaptation website, with Isabelle. I did the backend with APIs, DOM and Javascript.
- **Day 6:** WE LEARNED A-FRAME AND TRIED VR GOGGLES. IT WAS AMAZING. We first played around with it in the intro to aframe folder and then did an A-Frame basics lab and then moved onto more advanced things like animations. It seems like we didn't do much today but we had to learn a lot.
- **Day 7:** We learned to combine AFrame with DOM manipulation. The code along was with an instructor and then I worked on the lab. During the rest of the day, I worked on a vr tic tac toe game and loafed the rest of my time away. (In my defense, there wasn't enough time to tackle another thing. It was an awkward amount of time.)
- **Day 8-10:** FINAL PROJECT MODE. Very hectic. First day spent all the time on mazes. Second day spent all the time failing with the particles/my golden mist obstacle. Third day morning spent all the time trying to make it work.
